    <p>My work emerges from a desire to discover something new. I create interactive, multi-sensory works layered in sound and gesture, utilizing a diverse array of materials of archetypal and experimental form. Installations and compositions are living components of a larger ecology, drawing from a range of influences and inspired artistry across mediums, methods and traditions in both technical and non-technical settings. Works contemplate sensory constituents of perception, interplay, contrasts between natural and artificial, emotion, imagination, presence, permanence and ephemerality. Experiments and designs are intended to evoke presence and personal meaning, and shift with each participant’s interpretation in a particular moment. Emergent and conceptual frameworks are employed to invoke engagement and reflection. Compositions, improvisations and performances embrace interaction, environmental presence, autonomy, communication and transformation.</p>
