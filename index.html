    <p>
My work emerges from a desire to discover something new. I create interactive, multi-sensory works layered in sound and gesture, utilizing a diverse array of materials of archetypal and experimental form, embracing a range of influences and inspired artistry across mediums, methods and traditions in both technical and non-technical settings. Installations, experiments and compositions are designed as contemplations of the sensory constituents of perception, interplay, contrasts between natural and artificial, emotion, imagination, permanence and ephemerality – intended to evoke presence and personal meaning, and shift with each participant’s interpretation. Conceptual and architectonic frameworks are employed to invoke engagement and reflection, and embody improvisation, interaction, autonomy, expression and transformation.

    <h2 class="content-head is-center">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      My teaching philosophy has evolved over many years of teaching experience, and continues to evolve. I employ a wide variety of interactive strategies based on essential educational principles encompassing cognitive functioning, learning theory, diversity, instructional planning and assessment. As a devoted arts educator and educational leader, I trust that an educator should refine the craft of teaching with as much resolve and persistence as the craft being taught. Teaching is an art that requires a vast and diverse skill set. Not only does it require a mastery of the subject, but also an ability to inspire, identify and provide relevant context, deconstruct large frameworks and articulate complex ideas in unassuming ways, illustrate connections between insulated or modular concepts, possess a keen sensitivity to students’ progress, consistently model industry practices, and devise and nimbly adapt dissemination strategies to guide learners in achieving their goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work to foster inclusivity, an ability to think analytically, engagement in self-critique, critical listening, and an ability to identify and articulate criteria and personal value, and synthesize concepts and processes into new ideas and combinations of ideas. How one achieves these is likely unique for every individual. Learners select, interpret, and transform new information and experiences within a personal context. A simultaneous awareness of the individual, as well as the collective group, is required in a classroom setting, and I have found that a personal connection with each student is one of the most informative and supportive resources. This allows a teacher to identify a student’s entryway into the discourse, and incorporate a learner’s own interests and processes to facilitate connection with the material, spark inspiration and unlock alternative perspectives for fellow students. Each person brings intrinsic value to the room; identifying what that is, and utilizing those knowledges can benefit the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Student engagement has proven to be a vital element in facilitating active discovery in my classrooms. I endeavor to be a compassionate and encouraging advisor and mentor to my students, and I work to create a space where every student feels empowered to contribute to the process of constructing knowledge, co-own, share and shape the responsibility and purpose of the learning environment. I encourage students to constructively challenge what they know and are taught, and identify, experiment, modify or abandon their existing beliefs to pursue meaning and value for themselves. Often, their contribution leads to new trajectories and relevant paths that we may not have traversed as effectively or dynamically without their involvement. The learning outcomes of the course must be met, and a skillful instructor can facilitate the benchmarks within a collaborative and shared space while strengthening abilities for autonomous learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incorporating play into the discovery process is essential; I think humor and fun are as important as structure and trust. Trust can be cultivated by demonstrating that I have a plan for the students, that I have at least one path for them to be successful, those paths are made clear, and that I am someone that provides support, insight and direction on that path. Clarity in course structure is also important. A student’s time can be better spent without the need to decipher expectations, jump through unnecessary hoops, or seek inevident course resources. Of course, there is value in an ability to unearth resources when engaged in study and research, but providing resources in manageable packages provides guidance and elucidates criteria for success. This structural simplicity allows students to apply their time to contemplation, practice and development engaged in the intended material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important resources include clearly defined and relevant assessments, and timely feedback. I continually refine formative and summative assessments to more accurately measure students’ cognitive, psychomotor and affective proficiency with course objectives, utilizing an integrative process, one of evaluation of success facilitated by reflection, and practical integration of what has been learned, and the efficacy of its application in the next iteration of a course or program. My assessments are intended to be useful, provide meaningful information for the learner and the teacher, fair, ethical, systematic, challenging, realistic, and promote learning. I consider feedback practices integral to assessment and to a dialogic learning and teaching process. This includes dialogue between staff and students, self-assessment, and peer-assessment to develop assessment literacy and grow into autonomous learners, with reflective and evaluative skills, and capabilities for working collaboratively. A structured set of principles for feedback can help ensure consistent practice and help students utilize feedback to enable deeper understanding of core knowledge, and demonstrate alignment with professional values.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sincere enthusiasm for teaching and learning continues to grow, and my hope is that my work advantageously impacts learners, ultimately connecting them with their passion and with lifelong learning. It is an honor, and one that I undertake with seriousness and gratitude, that I am able to directly guide and support the future of art and artists.
